Analysis of League of Legends' 2022 dataset. 

Homework for EECS 398 at U-M

## Introduction
League of Legends is a popular multiplayer video game where two teams of 5 players battle to destroy each other’s base. The game map is split up into three lanes: top, middle, and bottom. Each team has towers in each lane that protect the base, and players of the opposing team have to destroy these turrets to advance and destroy the enemy base. The question we are looking to investigate further is how much of an impact destroying the first mid-tower has on winning.
We chose to work with Lthe eague of Legends’ dataset because we felt that working on a dataset from a popular video game would lead to a more personalized project that would be not only more appealing on our resumes but also since it’s something we are somewhat familiar with. Expanding on this, our familiarity with video game mechanics and terminology allows us to understand the significance of the various features better. Furthermore, working on real-world data we are passionate about increases our motivation for this project, and our analysis of this dataset could uncover insights that are valuable not only for academic purposes but also for practical applications in our gaming experiences.

## Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis

After cleaning our data by removing null values and selecting relevant features, we analyzed the relationship between team KPM (Kills Per Minute), total gold, and match outcomes.

The scatter plot above shows an interesting relationship between a team's KPM and their total gold accumulation, colored by match outcome. We can observe that teams with higher KPM and total gold tend to win more frequently, suggesting these are important predictors of match outcome.
### Univariate Analysis

### Bivariate Analysis
This pie chart displays the percentage of games teams win and lose when they successfully destroy the first mid-tower of the game. Our data suggests that teams who destroy the mid-tower first have a higher win rate than their counterparts. However, we must keep in mind that many other factors contribute to a game’s win, such as team kills, gold, and players’ in-game decisions.
